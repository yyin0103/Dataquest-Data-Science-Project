# Dataquest-Data-Science-Project

I decided to start my data analysis journey with the "Data Scientist in Python" path offered by the online project-based platform Dataquest.io, where I learn how to manipulate data, make predictions using machine learning, and utilize collaboration tools like Git and SQL etc. 

The courses includes:

1. Data Analysis, Visualization, & Cleaning
2. Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, basemap, scikit learn, and regular expressions (re)
3. Linux Command Line
4. git
5. SQL
6. Math: Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus
7. Maching Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Hyperparameter Optimization, Cross Validation, Clustering, Overfitting, Neural Networks, Decision Tree and so on.
